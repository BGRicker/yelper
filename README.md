Q&A 

- reactive css to imported data. Charts, graphs, etc. showing changes based on database
(stats on NBA site, upload new scores and the graphs/charts change)
- Star rating like yelp based on user reviews. A page of cumulative reviews for one place.

- DNS of VARIABLE.nomster.com, like www.nomster.heroku.com. Auto populate address prefix with variable
- show all places on a map, select different descriptions to cut down number of places shown





- is @place = Place.find(params[:place_id]) standard for locating the id of the model?
- creating alternate versions of a project on git (branches?)



Previously talked about
- Count number of reviews per place, sort places as "top places' by number of reviews"
