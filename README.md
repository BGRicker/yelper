Q&A 

- declare seperate variables for street, city, state and concatenating into one value to be geocoded, or pulling/parsing that information out of address information to sort by city, state, etc

- pulling stats from twitter, social networks (#mentions per time frame, hashtag monitoring)
- reactive css to imported data. Charts, graphs, etc. showing changes based on database
(stats on NBA site, upload new scores and the graphs/charts change) 
- Star rating like yelp based on user reviews. A page of cumulative reviews for one place.
- Autopopulating list when typing in names of places, like Yelp/Wikipedia
- git version control for if I want to mess around with layouts consequence free, be able to revert to an older version (maybe git checkout)
- Count number of reviews per place, sort places as "top places' by number of reviews"
- DNS of VARIABLE.nomster.com, like www.nomster.heroku.com. Auto populate address prefix with variable
- show all places on a map, select different descriptions to cut down number of places shown
